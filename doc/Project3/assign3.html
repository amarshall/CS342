<h1> Assignment 3 </h1>


<h2> Due date </h2>
<UL> 
<LI> Due by 11.59 PM EST on April 12th.

</UL>

<BR> 

Submit your code as per the provided instructions. A signup sheet will
be provided to you during class to setup an appointment with the TA to
provide a demo of your project. 

</UL>

<h3> Updates </h3>

</UL>

<h3> Assignment Goal </h3>

Apply the design principles and patterns you have learned so far to
develop and test code for the given problem.


<h3> Team Work </h3>

<UL>

<LI> You are required to work in teams of two students on this
project. Choose a team partner from the class, with whom you did not
work in assignment 2. You CANNOT collaborate or discuss the design,
implementation, or debugging ideas with any other team.

<LI> Both team members should be familiar with all aspects of the
code. During the demo, the TA will randomly pick one of the team
members to demo and answer questions. Failure to show familiarity with
any part of the code will result in deduction of 50% of the assignment
grade for both team members.

</UL>


<h3> Programming Language </h3>
You are required to program this project in Java.

<h3> Compilation Method </H3> 

<UL>
<LI> You are required to use </I> ANT </I> for the following:
  <UL>
   <LI> Compiling the code 
   <LI> running the code
   <LI> Generating a tarball for submission
   <LI> Generating javadocs
</UL>

<LI> Your code should compile and run on <I> bingsuns </I> or the <I>
debian-pods </I> in the Computer Science lab in the Engineering
Building.

</UL> 


<h3> Policy on sharing of code </h3>

<LI> EVERY line of code that you submit in this assignment should be
written by your team or be part of the code template provided for this
assignment. Do NOT show your code to any other group. Our
code-comparison software can very easily detect similarities.

<LI> Post to the listserv if you have any questions about the
requirements. Do NOT post your code to the listserv asking for help
with debugging. However, it is okay to post design/concept questions
on programming in Java/C/C++.

</UL>

<H2> Project Description  </H2>

<H3> Search based Customer Support for Trouble Shooting </H3>

The dSeaGate Portable Drive vendor wants to provide an online trouble
shooter for customers. Your task is to design the engine for this purpose. The requirements are the following:

<UL> 

<LI> dSeaGate has four distinct products. It has 3 versions of each of
these products. For each product, it also has an ArrayList of strings.
Each element of these ArrayLists is a string representing a sentence.

<LI> Users can enter text (one string or many strings) in a search box
to describe their problem. Only keywords, or key phrases, are entered.
For this assignment, accept keywords from an input file named,
userInputs.txt. Each search should be in a different line.

<LI> dSeaGate does not want a sophisticated search algorithm, for now.
So, it wants the following to be done for all searches:

<UL>

   <LI> <I>Exact match</I>: Find and display on stdout all technical
   sentences that have an exact match for the entered keywords. So, if
   the user enters "problem detecting", a technical sentence that
   matches could be the following: "If Windows 7 has a problem
   detecting the drive, it could be that the portable drive is not
   receiving enough power."

   <LI> <I>Naive Stemming match</I>: Find and display on stdout all
   technical sentences that have a word, whose substring is an exact
   match for the first entered keyword. So, if the user enters "detect
   error", the technical sentence that matches could be the following:
   "If Windows 7 has a problem detecting the drive, it could be that
   the portable drive is not receiving enough power."

   <LI><I>Semantic match</I>: Find the synonym of the last entered
   keyword by the user and employ "Exact match." Use an input file
   synonym.txt to store key-value pairs of synonyms.
  Read the synonyms from the file, during startup, and
   store them in an appropriate data structure. So, if the user
   enters "comptabile CPU", the technical sentence that matches could
   be the following: "All products from AMD have a compatible
   processor as far as dSeaGate is concerned." The file synonym.txt
   should have the the following using a format of your choosing. <P>

   CPU:processor
 </P>

   <LI> The file userInputs.txt should have 27 entries. 8 entries
   should work with "Exact match", 8 with "one-word match", and 8 with
   "semantic match." 3 should not match at all. The 24 matches should
   spread across the 12 different dSeaGate prdocuts.

    <LI> Technical sentences for each product
    should be read from a file (or multiple files, as per your design)
    and stored in the ArrayLists. The names of the files should be
    stored in an Enum, and picked up from there by the code that
    populates the ArrayLists with the sentences.

    <LI> Searches should be case sensistive.

</UL>

<LI> Data from the local file will be read by a single thread. So, do
NOT design for a multi-threaded application.

<BR>

<LI> Use Debug in the following manner: 
<UL>

<LI> 0: No output should be printed. Only error messages should be
printed (for example, message from a catch caluse before exiting).

<LI> 1: Only the search results should be printed
<LI> 2: Design on your own and mention in the README what is printed at this debug granularity 
<LI> 3: Design on your own and mention in the README what is printed at this debug granularity 
<LI> 4: Design on your own and mention in the README what is printed at this debug granularity 
</UL>

</UL>

<H2> Design Requirements </H2>

<UL>
<LI>  Same as Assignment-1
<LI>  Revisit the Assignment-1 page, and search for "NEW".
</UL> 

<H2>  Code Organization </H2>

<UL>
<LI> Your directory structure should be the following:

<PRE>
 -firstName_lastName_firstName_lastName
   ---customerSearch
     ----- build.xml
     ----- README.txt
     ----- src
          ---customerSearch
     	   ----------driver
           ----------util
           ----------other packages that you need

</PRE>

</UL>


<H2>  Code Templates </H2>
<UL> 
<LI> None provided for this assignment.
</UL>

<H2>  Submission </H2>

<UL>
<LI> Same as Assignment-1. Additionally, only one team member should upload to blackboard.

</UL>

<H2> Late Submissions </H2>

<UL>

<LI> The policy for late submissions is that you will lose 10% of the
grade for each day that your submission is delayed.
