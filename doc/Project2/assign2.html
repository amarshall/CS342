<h1> Assignment 2  </h1>


<h2> Due date </h2>
<UL> 
<LI> March 10th, 11.59 PM EST

<BR> 

Submit your code as per the provided instructions. A signup sheet will
be provided to you during class to setup an appointment with the TA to
provide a demo of your project.

<h3> Assignment Goal </h3>

Apply the design principles and patterns you have learned so far to
develop and test code for the given problem.


<h3> Team Work </h3>

<UL>
<LI> You have to work in teams of 2 studens each for this project. You
CANNOT collaborate or discuss the design, implementation, or debugging
ideas with any other team. If you cannot find a team mate, contact the
instructor.

<LI> Both team members should be familiar with all aspects of the
code. During the demo, the TA will randomly pick one of the team
members to demo and answer questions. Failure to show familiarity with
any part of the code will result in deduction of 50% of the assignment
grade for both team members.

</UL>


<h3> Programming Language </h3>
You are required to program this project in Java.

<h3> Compilation Method </H3> 

<UL>
<LI> You are required to use </I> ANT </I> for the following:
  <UL>
   <LI> Compiling the code 
   <LI> running the code
   <LI> Generating a tarball for submission
   <LI> Generating javadocs
</UL>

<LI> Your code should compile and run on <I> bingsuns </I> or the <I>
debian-pods </I> in the Computer Science lab in the Engineering
Building.

</UL> 


<h3> Policy on sharing of code </h3>

<LI> EVERY line of code that you submit in this assignment should be
written by your team or be part of the code template provided for this
assignment. Do NOT show your code to any other group. Our
code-comparison software can very easily detect similarities.

<LI> Post to the listserv if you have any questions about the
requirements. Do NOT post your code to the listserv asking for help
with debugging. However, it is okay to post design/concept questions
on programming in Java/C/C++.

</UL>

<H2> Project Description  </H2>

<H3> Tool for New Students at BU</H3>
<UL>

You need to develop a tool for student orientation program at
Binghamton University. The orientation checklist consists of taking a
campus tour, buying books, selecting a dorm, and registering for
courses. There is time, cost, carbon footprint, and effort associated
with each of these activities. Effort is measured in the number of
calories spent on the activity. Carbon-footprint is measured in tonnes
of CO<sub>2</sub>.


Each student is required to complete
the checklist before start of classes. However, all students have some
flexibility in how and when they go about completing each activity.


<LI> There are 2 different bookstores to choose from: University Book
Store, Mando Boooks. The price difference is within
5% in these book stores.

<LI> The options for campus tour include the following: bus-ride or
on-foot. The bus-ride costs $2.00, while the tour on-foot is $0.10. 

<LI> Selecting a dorm has two options: standing in a long queue
outside the dorms administrator's office for your turn or through an
online gaming contest that assigns dorms based on your game
performance. Using the online option has a 2% surcharge.

<LI> Registration can be done by submitting forms to 
the registrar's office or by accessing the registration system using
computers from a specific computer-lab in the Engineering building.
Submitting forms requires payment via check, which makes tuition 3%
cheaper.

<LI> Assign time in minutes for each activitiy (use your own estimate).

<LI> Assign appropriate carbon footprint value for each activity (use your
own estimates).

<LI> Use your own estimate to decide how to calculate (or assign a
value) to the calories spent for each activity.

<LI> Create a set of classes/interfaces that can be used for each
student's orientation program. Write a driver program that can be used
by each student to calculate the total time, cost, and effort of the
orientation, based on her/his choices.
