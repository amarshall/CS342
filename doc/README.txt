  This is a template README file about how you should form your own README file.
  In general,
        you should remove anything in between square brackets (i.e. [..]), and
        you should replace anything in between <> with a value.

PROJECT <PROJECT NUMBER> README FILE

Due Date: <PROJECT DUE DATE, IN FORMAT: Monday, January 1, 2011>
Submission Date: <DATE YOU SUBMIT, IN FORMAT: Monday, January 1, 2011>
Grace Period Used This Project: <DAYS> Days
Grace Period Remaining: <DAYS> Days
Author(s): <FULL NAME> [and <OTHER FULL NAME>, if group]
e-mail(s): <YOUR E-MAIL ADDRESS HERE> [and <OTHER E-MAIL>, if group]


PURPOSE:

[
  Document here what you perceive as what your project simply tries to
  accomplish. If your project has extra functionality, do not document them
  here, put them in the section titled EXTRA CREDIT below.
]

PERCENT COMPLETE:

[
  Document here what percentage of your responsibilities you have completed
  that were assigned to you for this project, with a small explanation of your
  judgement. For example: "I believe I have completed 100% of this project."
  OR "I believe I have completed 90% of this project, since I haven't
  understood the last part completely."
]

PARTS THAT ARE NOT COMPLETE:

[
  Document here what parts are missing and/or incomplete. For example:
  "Debugging functions are incomplete, some of the print statement are missing".
  Be as much clear as possible.
]

BUGS:

[
  Document here the bugs in your program that you are aware but have no idea
  why they exist, NOT the ones you solved. For example "For some reason, I
  cannot seem to send 4 bytes of data in a package, but when I increase the
  package to 8 bytes, then everything works correctly". Don't try to be
  creative here, if you do not see any bugs, say "None".
]

FILES:

[
  Document here a list of the files that are necessary for the project to run.
  Here is a sample:

  Included with this project are 5 files:

  BinaryNode.java, the file which does the binary tree
  Tree.java, the file responsible for the printing and basics of the tree
  Project3.java, the main file associated with the program also contains main
  File.txt, the file that contains the data to be printed on the tree
  README, the text file you are presently reading
]

SAMPLE OUTPUT:

[
  Copy and paste a recent CORRECT output from your test runs, ALONG with the
  command line. Cut it short if more than 10 lines. Here is a sample:

  [erdil@the_caribbean:~erdil]$ ./a.out topaz 12345 binaenaleyh
  SOME OUTPUT
  SOME MORE
  WOW, IT DOES NOT END
  [snip here] (-> if too long)
  OH MY..
  FINALLY
  [erdil@the_caribbean:~erdil]$
]

TO COMPILE:

[
  Document here how your TA can build your program after extracting your
  gzipped-tarball. (Note: ideally, TA should just do a "make". Justify extra
  steps needed). Be as clear as possible, refer to "... FOR DUMMIES" book
  format. Assume your TA is completely lost, trying to save the universe.
  Here is a sample:

  Just extract the files and then do a "make".
]

TO RUN:

[
  Document here how your TA can test your program after extracting your gzipped-
  tarball. Be as clear as possible, refer to "... FOR DUMMIES" book format.
  Assume your TA is completely lost, there is another universe. Here is a
  sample:

  Please run as: ./a.out <REGHOST> <REGPORT> <UNIQNAME>
  For example:   ./a.out topaz 12345 binaenaleyh
]

EXTRA CREDIT:

[
  Document here extra work you have done to get bonus grade, IF THERE IS ANY.
  Otherwise, say "N/A"
