<h1> Assignment 4 </h1>


<h2> Due date </h2>
<UL> 
<LI> Due by demo time on Friday, April 27th.

</UL>

<BR> 

Submit your code as per the provided instructions. A signup sheet will
be provided to you during class to setup an appointment with the TA to
provide a demo of your project. 

</UL>

<h3> Updates </h3>

<UL>
</UL>

<h3> Assignment Goal </h3>

Apply the design principles and patterns you have learned so far to
develop and test code for the given problem.


<h3> Team Work </h3>

<UL>

<LI> You are required to work in teams of two students on this
project. Continue with the project partner from the previous
assignment. You CANNOT collaborate or discuss the design,
implementation, or debugging ideas with any other team.


<LI> Both team members should be familiar with all aspects of the
code. During the demo, the TA will randomly pick one of the team
members to demo and answer questions. Failure to show familiarity with
any part of the code will result in deduction of 50% of the assignment
grade for both team members.

</UL>


<h3> Programming Language </h3>
You are required to program this project in Java.

<h3> Compilation Method </H3> 

<UL>
<LI> You are required to use </I> ANT </I> for the following:
  <UL>
   <LI> Compiling the code 
   <LI> running the code
   <LI> Generating a tarball for submission
   <LI> Generating javadocs
</UL>

<LI> Your code should compile and run on <I> bingsuns </I> or the <I>
debian-pods </I> in the Computer Science lab in the Engineering
Building.

</UL> 


<h3> Policy on sharing of code </h3>

<LI> EVERY line of code that you submit in this assignment should be
written by your team or be part of the code template provided for this
assignment. Do NOT show your code to any other group. Our
code-comparison software can very easily detect similarities.

<LI> Post to the listserv if you have any questions about the
requirements. Do NOT post your code to the listserv asking for help
with debugging. However, it is okay to post design/concept questions
on programming in Java/C/C++.

</UL>

<H2> Project Description  </H2>

<H3> dWindows TaskManager </H3>

Develop a text based dashboard for a TaskManager. Check out the
TaskManager on any Windows based OS for an example. There are three
tabs on the dashboard for this assignment.

<UL>
<LI> <I>Processes</I>. It has the following information: ProcessName: value, UserName: value, CPU: value, Memory: value, Description: value
<LI> <I>Performance</I>: It has the following information; Current Memory usage: value, current CPU usage: value. Total Physical memory: value, Total Cached: value. 
<LI> <I>Users</I>: It has the following information: userName: value, status: value. <font color="blue">The options for status are: active, inactive, disconnected</font>
</UL> 

<LI> For the information required to display in the dashboard, read
synthetic data from a local file, one line at a time, process it, and
update the display accordingly.

<LI> Explain the format of the data in your README.txt file. You can
choose any text-based format that you find easy to parse and process.
The synthetic data should include data in different lines. Processing
of each line should affect at least one tab of the dashboard.  

<LI> The format in each line may be different. For example, it is ok
to have the first word of a line indicate which tab the data is for.

<LI> Note that the tab for Total Memory and Total CPU should be
updated whenever it is read from the input file.

<LI> The Total Physical memory and Total cached memory, displayed in
the <I>performance tab </I> are constant. Decide, and mention in the
README.txt, how it is stored in the input file.

<LI> Data from the local file should be read by a
single thread. So, do NOT design for a multi-threaded
application.

<LI> The dashboard should show up-to-date information for all the
information that a user wants to keep track of. It should write to
stdout as it gets new information after reading a line of input.
However, the update of one tab (or information in a tab) need not
automatically update other tabs.

<LI> The dashboard should also store all the information it receives.
So. separate out the display module from the storage module.

<P>

<LI> <font color="blue">How would the processes be impacted by a change
from "Active" to "Disconnected"?. Answer: No change.</font>

<LI> <font color="blue">If a user logs off, is it
acceptable to terminate all of their > processes in addition to
removing them from the list of users? Answer: It is acceptable, but
not required.</font>

<LI> <font color="blue">Should the information to be
displayed stored? Answer: separate data structure(s) should be
designed to store the information. The "display" should just display.
So, if I add a GUI requirement, just the display module will change and
nothing else.</font>

<LI> <font color="blue"> Are we to display all the
 Processes information, Performance information, and Users information
 every time something is read from the file, and regardless as to
 whether they change as a result? For example, a user logs in, but
 this only affects the Users tab. Should we still display all three?
 Answer: No, just display the new information on stdout corresponding
 to the entry in the input file. Do not display everything. </font>

<P>

<LI> Use Debug in the following manner: 
<UL>

<LI> 0: No output should be printed. Only error messages should be
printed (for example, message from a catch caluse before exiting).

<LI> 1: Only ouput from the dashboard should be printed
<LI> 2: Design on your own and mention in the README what is printed at this debug granularity 
<LI> 3: Design on your own and mention in the README what is printed at this debug granularity 
<LI> 4: Design on your own and mention in the README what is printed at this debug granularity 
</UL>

</UL>

<H2> Design Requirements </H2>

<UL>
<LI>  Same as Assignment-1
<LI>  Revisit the Assignment-1 page, and search for "NEW".
</UL> 

<H2>  Code Organization </H2>

<UL>
<LI> Your directory structure should be the following:

<PRE>
 -firstName_lastName_firstName_lastName
   ---taskManager
     ----- build.xml
     ----- README.txt
     ----- src
          ---taskManager
     	   ----------driver
           ----------util
           ----------other packages that you need

</PRE>

</UL>


<H2>  Code Templates </H2>
<UL> 
<LI> None provided for this assignment.
</UL>

<H2>  Submission </H2>

<UL>

<LI> Same as Assignment-1. Additionally, only one team member should
upload to blackboard.

</UL>

<H2> Late Submissions </H2>

<UL>

<LI> The policy for late submissions is that you will lose 10% of the
grade for each day that your submission is delayed.
