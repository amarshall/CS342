<h3> Assignment Goal </h3>

Apply the design principles you have learned so far to develop and
test code for the given problem. Apply the proxy and strategy
patterns, and any other applicable pattern(s).



<h3> Team Work </h3>

You have to work alone on this project. You CANNOT collaborate or
discuss the design, implementation, or debugging ideas with any other
students. However, discussion on design is encouraged via the
listserv.


<h3> Programming Language </h3>
You are required to program this project in Java.

<h3> Compilation Method </H3> 

<UL>
<LI> You are required to use </I> ANT </I> for the following:
  <UL>
   <LI> Compiling the code 
   <LI> running the code
   <LI> Generating a tarball for submission
   <LI> Generating javadocs
</UL>

<LI> Your code should compile and run on <I> bingsuns </I> or the <I>
debian-pods </I> in the Computer Science lab in the Engineering
Building.

</UL> 


<h3> Policy on sharing of code </h3>

<LI> EVERY line of code that you submit in this assignment should be
written by your team or be part of the code template provided for this
assignment. Do NOT show your code to any other group. Our
code-comparison software can very easily detect similarities.

<LI> Post to the listserv if you have any questions about the
requirements. Do NOT post your code to the listserv asking for help
with debugging. However, it is okay to post design/concept questions
on programming in Java/C/C++.

<H2>  Project Description  </H2>

<H3> Generic Event Listener </H3>

The purpose of this assignment is to create a generic event
serializer. The code should allow the conversion of objects into
different <I>wire-formats</I>. The code should be designed using
dynamic proxies and reflection so that addition of new objects or
serialization formats causes minimal changes (reduces the ripple
effect).

<UL> 

<LI> Creating the Dynamic Proxy

<UL>
<LI> The Client/Driver code should call the <I> createProxy </I>
method in the ProxyCreator utility class to create a dynamic proxy reference. The
code inside the createProxy method is shown below. 


<PRE>
 RemoteEvent remoteEvent =
            (RemoteEvent)
            Proxy.newProxyInstance(
                                   getClass().getClassLoader(),
                                   interfaceArray,
                                   handler
                                   );

</PRE>

<LI> Pass an array of interfaces to the createProxy method with the
following interfaces (RemoteLogger, RemoteViz, RemoteExecution).

<PRE>

public interface RemoteLogger extends RemoteEvent {
      void writeLogger(LogStore logStoreIn, int sequenceNo, string serializationFormat);
      SerializableObject readLogger(string wireFormat, string serializationFormat);
}

public interface RemoteViz extends RemoteEvent {
      void writeViz(VizDetails vizDetailsIn, int sequenceNo, string serializationFormat);
      SerializableObject readViz(string wireFormat, string serializationFormat);
}

public interface RemoteExecution extends RemoteEvent {
      void writeExecution(ExecDetails execDetailsIn, int sequenceNo, string serializationFormat);
      SerializableObject readExecution(string wireFormat, string serializationFormat);
}

</PRE>

<LI> Pass an invocation handler (an instance of EventSerializer) to
the createProxy() utility method.

</UL>

<LI> RemoteEvent.java should be a <I> tag  </I> interface.

<LI> Each of the 3 RemoteEvent interfaces should be exactly as specified above.

</UL>

<LI> Define the objects LogStore, VizDetails, and ExecDetails with at
least two primitive data members each. Design them like JavaBeans
(with getX and setX methods for all data members). Each of these three
objects should extend SerializableObject.

<LI> SerializableObject is an empty class, so it serves the role of a
marker. 

<LI> If you add new method names to the interfaces note that the
methods names in the interfaces of RemoteEvent should be unique (don't
use the same method name in two different interfaces, as it will cause
problems with dynamic proxy usage).

<LI> The client/driver code should invoke methods on the dynamic
proxy, as if it is invoking methods on an object that implements the 3
interfaces mentioned below. Remember to cast the dynamic proxy to the
correct interface before invoking the method.

<LI> Each invocation will transfer control to the <I> invoke </I>
method of the invocation handler.

<LI> In the invocation handler do the following:

<UL>

<LI> Write data to a file based on the following requirements:

<LI> If the serialization format is "xml", then add XML tags to all
the data written to the file. You can make up tag names.

<LI> If the serialization format is "plaintext" just write the
following data to the file, with newlines appropriately placed so that
the output is readable.

<UL>

<LI> the type (fully qualified name) for each of the arguments
the client invocation received by the invoke() method (in the args[]
array). [use java reflection API.] 

<LI> the method name that was invoked

<LI> the declaring class name for the method invocation (use
getDeclaringClass() on the Method argument).

<LI> For the argument received that is a user defined complex type,
write all the data member types and values in that object. [use Java
reflection API].

</UL>

</UL>

<LI> Event Deserialization

<UL>
<LI> In the driver code, create a proxy for deserialization.

<LI> Read the text file generated in the serialization step into a
string. Invoke a method on the deserialization proxy and pass the
string. Use Java reflection to create a new instance of the object
using the string. <font color="red">So, you need to deserialize just
the complex type, and not the method arguments</font>. Note that the
state of the serialized object should match the state of the
deserialized object.

</UL>

<LI> Flow of Control

<UL>
<LI> Create Dynamic Proxy for Serialization
<LI> Create Dynamic Proxy for De-Serialization
<LI> Create one instance each for LogStore, VizDetails, and ExecDetails.

<LI> Use the serialization proxy to invoke a method of each of the 3
interfaces (RemoteLogger, RemoteViz, RemoteExecution). Pass the
relevant arguments.

<LI> Whenever a method is invoked on the proxy, the corresponding
invocation handler code is called. Serialize the object to a file.

<LI> Use the deserialization proxy to read the wire-format from the
file by invoking the corresponding readX methods, create an instance of the relevant object, invoke the setX
methods to set the state, and compare the newly created object with
the serialized instance to ensure they are <I> equal </I>.

</UL>

<H2>  Code Templates </H2>
<UL> 
<LI> None provided for this assignment.
</UL>


<H2> Example Serialization Formats </H2>
<UL> 

<LI> Here is an example of the <a href="./logStore1.txt">XML
format</a> when the writeLogger(...) method is called. Assume that the
LogStore class has two data members: int storeId, and string
dbConnection. The values of these data members at the time of
serialization are 17 and "sqlserver.binghamton.edu:3456".

<LI> Caution: This example may not be 100% compliant with the
standard (but is close ...)

<LI> You can hardcode the generation of the first line "&lt;?xml
version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>" each time the serialized format
needs to be generated. 

<LI> Again, hardcode the namespace information that appears after the
tag name "EventSerialization". Namespaces in XML is an interesting
topic of discussion (but for some other course).

<LI> Note how the serialization of the complex type "LogStore" and the
other arguments sequenceNumer and serializationFormat seem to follow a
"template". Design your code accordingly.

<LI> Instead of using an XML parser, during de-serialization, you can
use the rich string API in Java to search for specific values. For
example, search for the value of the attribute xsi:type of a
complexType to obtain "genericEventProcessor.util.LogStore". Next,
create an instance of an object with this type name.

<LI> The <a href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/ALT/Reflection/">following web page </a> has useful examples on how
to use Java reflection.
